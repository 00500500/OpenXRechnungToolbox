- layout of validation report in header broken
	--> browser specific, only happens in swt-browser; 
	    after saving to external file and displaying with, for example, Firefox, everything it's fine.
	    Workaround: adaption of CSS template, increasing width in header from 230px to 250px.
- fragment in help page url not used
	--> java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop.browse does not consume fragment in URL, therefore anchors in help urls are not used
